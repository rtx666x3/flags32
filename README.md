# 3:2 flags for football national teams

This repository contains standardized 3:2 flags for national teams divided by confederations where they are aligned. It also contains flags of former teams like Czechoslovakia or Zaire.
Flags are named by their FIFA code. If a country or territory does not belong to FIFA and does not have a FIFA code, I put codes that would most likely fit the team.

Teams included in this repository are all those teams that are in data from this dataset: https://github.com/martj42/international_results + the UK flag (if someone wants to use it just for another goal, however, the UK flag will be in the non-FIFA folder because the UK is not in the FIFA)
